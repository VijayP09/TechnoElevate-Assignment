Q1)when we go for length & length().
1. The length variable is applicable to an array but not for string objects.
1.The length() method is applicable for string objects but not for arrays.
2. length can be used for int[], double[], String[] to know the length of the arrays.
2. length() can be used for String, StringBuilder, etc.  String class related Objects to know the length of the String
3. To directly access a field member of an array we can use .length;
3. length() invokes a method to access a field member.
4.ex.
public class Length {
	 public static void main(String[] args)  {
	        int[] array = new int[4];
	        System.out.println("The size of the array is "+ array.length);
	        String str = "Vijay";
	        System.out.println("The size of the String is "
	                           + str.length());
	    }

}
Q2)Multiple Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance in Java: 
Defining derived class from numerous base classes is known as ‘Multiple Inheritance’. 
In this case, there is more than one superclass, and there can be one or more subclasses. 
Multiple inheritances are available in object-oriented programming with C++, but it is not available in Java. 
Java developers want to use multiple inheritances in some cases.
 Fortunately, Java developers have interface concepts expecting the developers to achieve multiple inheritances by using multiple interfaces. 
Ex: class Myclass implements interface1, interface2,…. 
ex. 
class A10{  
void msg(){
	System.out.println("Hello");
	}  
}  
class B{  
void msg(){
	System.out.println("Welcome");
	}  
}  
class C extends A,B {
   public static void main(String args[]){  
   C obj=new C();  
   obj.msg();
}  
}  
Q3)Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance in Java: 
Hybrid Inheritance in Java is a combination of Inheritances. 
In this type of Inheritance, more than one kind of inheritance is observed.
For example, if we have class A and class B that extend class C and then there is another class D that extends class A, then this type of Inheritance is known as Hybrid Inheritance.
Why? Because we clearly observe that there is two kinds of inheritance here- Hierarchical and Single Inheritance.
In the diagram shown below, we see another example of Hybrid Inheritance.
