Collection Framework:
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).
A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.
What is a framework in Java
o It provides readymade architecture.
o It represents a set of classes and interfaces.
o It is optional.
What is Collection framework
The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It has:
1. Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
2. Algorithm
Let us see the hierarchy of Collection framework. The java.util package contains all the classes and interfaces for the Collection framework.
When Java was born, the only data structure support built into the core libraries involved arrays, vectors (essentially dynamically-sized arrays), and hash tables (for key-value pairs). Support for such key data structures as balanced trees, generic bags of objects, and priority queues didn't exist, but could certainly be created. Thus, many developers added their own structures to the libraries.
